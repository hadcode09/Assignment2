    <h1>A Presentation about me</h1>
        <br>
        
        <p>I would first like to introduce myself. My name is Mark Anthony Hadley, but please call me M.A. I am originally from Texas, but I now live in SoCal. I decided to take this course because I really want to learn some things about coding. </p>
            
        <p> Also, it was great opportunity to use my military benifits before it was too late. I believe if I have a chance to grow why wait when the sky is the limit. I'm just grateful to be active again. </p>
